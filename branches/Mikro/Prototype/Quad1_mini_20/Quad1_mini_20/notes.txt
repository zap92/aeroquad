Notes about ArduIMU Quadcopter configuration...

ESC setup
 - I connected only one ESC BEC (red wire) to the ArduIMU, the other 3 ESC´s only use two wires(white and black). 
   I made this on the male servo connector (The block with the four connectors, see Photos). Only one connector has 3 pins, the other has 2 pins (remove the central pin)
 - All ESC´s must have the same throttle range (I adjusted manually)
 - I change the timing to "Normal" setup (don´t use Hard timing). You can leave the default setting also.

Motor and propellers mount
 - To compensate the yaw right and left motors has some twist (see photos)
 - I am using prop savers for the propellers. I make some cuts with a cutter to the prop saver (below the propeller) so it not slips easily.

ArduIMU mount
 - Use a soft double side tape (or some layers) to mount the ArduIMU. You want to filter part of the vibrations from the motors
   Remember that vibrations are our enemy!!

ArduIMU programming
 - Be sure the main Quad battery is Disconnected.
 - I disconnect the ESC with the BEC to programm the ArduIMU (in my case is the right motor ESC). If you don´t do this you hear some "strange" beeps from ESC´s...

Radio setup
 - You should put the number of channels to read "#define MAX_CHANNELS 7". This depends on your configuration (with Jordi´s PPM encoder this should be 7). If this number is not correct you see that the radio values that appears on start are bad, so try again...

IMU setup 
 - We have to take the offset values for the IMU sensors. Put the IMU flat and read the values that appear on screen. 
   To take acc_offset_z value you should put the IMU at 90º (or substract g_value to the flat z reading...)
 - Adjust Gyro gains (you can adjust first yaw gyro gain and then you should use OUTPUTMODE=0 to adjust roll and pitch gyro, see ArduIMU info...) (This is step is optional, to let the IMU calibrated)

QUAD PID gains
 - The gains depends on quad size, motor, weight... so take this values as a first approach.

Please be carefull, quadcopters are not toys... but are fun... :-)
